## Adding Videos and Pictures in MDX

- **MDX** (Markdown for JSX) allows you to seamlessly integrate rich media content such as videos and images within your Markdown files. This guide provides an overview of how to embed videos and images effectively, while also offering tips on handling video IDs for better organization and reference.

## Embedding Images

- To add an image in MDX, you can use the following syntax:

```mdx
![Alt text](path/to/image.jpg)
```

### Using Image IDs

- When dealing with images, consider using unique identifiers for each image to maintain organization within your application. You can create an ID using alphanumeric characters, underscores, or dashes, such as:
- `image_001`
- `product_image_2024`

Ensure that the ID is unique to avoid conflicts across your project.

### Adding Images with the `src` Attribute

For more control over your images, you can either use Markdown syntax or HTML tags. Here’s how to include images in both ways:

#### Basic Markdown Syntax

The standard Markdown syntax for images works well for most cases:

```mdx
![Alt text](path/to/image.jpg)
```

This displays an image with the specified `src` path.

#### Using the `<img>` Tag

To gain more control over styling or attributes, use the `<img>` HTML tag within MDX. This method allows you to define the `src`, `alt`, `width`, `height`, and custom `id` for easier reference.

```mdx
<img src="/images/example.jpg" alt="Descriptive Alt Text" width="500" height="300" id="image_01" />
```

### Important Attributes for `<img>`

1. **`src`**: The path to your image file, which can be a local path (`/images/example.jpg`) or a URL (`https://example.com/image.jpg`).
2. **`alt`**: A text description for accessibility and SEO.
3. **`id`** (optional): A unique identifier for styling or JavaScript manipulation, such as `product_image_01`.
4. **`width` and `height`**: Define dimensions to control image display size, which is useful for responsive layouts.

### Example Usage

```mdx
# My Image Gallery

Here is an image with more attributes for styling:

<img src="https://via.placeholder.com/600x400" alt="Sample placeholder image" width="600" height="400" id="gallery_image_01" />
```

### Notes on Image Paths

- **Local Images**: When working with locally stored images in Next.js or other static-site generators, ensure the image is placed in the `public` directory for the path to work properly. For example, `<img src="/images/example.jpg" />` assumes `example.jpg` is stored in `public/images`.

This approach gives you flexibility in controlling your images and their attributes, enhancing both functionality and aesthetics in MDX files.

## Embedding Videos

You can embed videos in MDX using the standard HTML `<iframe>` tag or specific React components if your project supports them. Here’s a basic example using YouTube:

```mdx
<iframe
  width="560"
  height="315"
  src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VIDEO_ID"
  title="YouTube video player"
  frameBorder="0"
  allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"
  allowFullScreen
></iframe>
```

### Video ID Management

For videos, particularly from platforms like YouTube, you'll need the specific video ID, typically an 11-character string found in the URL. For example, in `https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIDEO_ID`, the `VIDEO_ID` is the part you need.

When creating your own videos or embedding them from other sources, ensure to assign a unique ID following these guidelines:

- Use alphanumeric characters, underscores, and dashes.

- Keep the ID concise yet meaningful, like `video_tutorial_01` or `demo_2024`.

### Example of Embedding a YouTube Video

To embed a video with an ID like `6h649f2fB9Q`, you can use an `<iframe>` tag as shown below:

```mdx
<iframe
  id="video_6h649f2fB9Q"
  width="560"
  height="315"
  src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6h649f2fB9Q"
  title="Video Title"
  frameBorder="0"
  allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"
  allowFullScreen
></iframe>
```

### Using a Custom Video Component

If you have a custom `<Video />` component set up in your MDX project that accepts `src` and `id` props, you can implement it like this:

```mdx
<Video id="video_6h649f2fB9Q" src="/path-to-your-video.mp4" controls />
```

This is particularly useful if the video file is hosted locally or within your project directory.

### Example of a `<Video />` Component (in JSX or MDX)

You can create a reusable `<Video />` component as follows:

```jsx
export default function Video({ id, src }) {
  return (
    <video id={id} width="560" height="315" controls>
      <source src={src} type="video/mp4" />
      Your browser does not support the video tag.
    </video>
  );
}
```

Then, in your MDX file, you could use:

```mdx
<Video id="video_6h649f2fB9Q" src="/videos/sample-video.mp4" />
```

This setup provides flexibility in embedding videos while allowing for unique IDs for styling or script-based manipulation.

## Summary

Incorporating images and videos into your MDX files can significantly enhance the richness and engagement of your content. By utilizing unique IDs for your media assets, you can manage and reference them more effectively.
